        <h1>About Digital Safety</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          In today's digital era, technology has become an integral part of everyday life. 
          While it offers immense opportunities, it also exposes women to risks such as 
          cyberbullying, phishing, privacy breaches, and online harassment. In today’s digital age, the internet has become an essential part of everyday life, providing countless opportunities for learning, communication, and personal growth. However, along with these advantages come new risks, especially for women and young girls. Digital safety is about protecting oneself from online threats such as cyberbullying, identity theft, phishing attacks, and privacy breaches. Many people are unaware of how easily personal information can be accessed, misused, or shared without consent. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and online forums, while useful, can also expose users to harassment, scams, and misinformation. At Raksha Netra, we believe that awareness and education are the first steps toward online safety. Simple measures, such as creating strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly updating privacy settings, can significantly reduce the risk of cyberattacks. It is equally important to recognize suspicious messages, avoid clicking on unknown links, and report any form of harassment to the appropriate authorities. Digital safety also involves maintaining a healthy balance between online and offline life, as excessive exposure to social media can affect mental wellbeing and self-esteem. Women should feel confident navigating the digital world, using technology as a tool for empowerment, learning, and connection. By providing resources, guidance, and practical tips, Raksha Netra aims to create a supportive digital environment where women can interact freely, make informed decisions, and protect their personal information. Ensuring digital safety is not just a technical requirement; it is an essential part of empowering women to live safely, confidently, and independently in a connected world. Through education, awareness, and proactive practices, we can all contribute to a safer and more secure online space for everyone.
          At <strong>Raksha Netra</strong>, our mission is to equip women with knowledge, tools, and guidance to stay safe online. 
          Digital safety is not just about technology—it’s about empowerment, confidence, and awareness.
